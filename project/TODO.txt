Project
- (FM,WM, DONE?) Use normal!, noremap and noremenu consistently.

  documented somewhere?

Templates:
- (WM) Correct escape for menu names.
  * At least these special characters must be escaped: <space> . | \ &
  * Expanded menus for lists.
- (WM) API 'EditTemplateFiles'.
  * (DONE) Check whether an indexed file actually exists.
  * Configuration of the file browser (+ documentation).
- (WM) When overwriting templates, also set new map and shortcut, if one is
  given.
- (WM) Help templates.
  * The browser for help templates should be called by a dedicated function in
    the help template.
  * The browser should be configurable from outside, so it does not have to be
    set up within the template library.

Awk:
- (FM) 'code->comment' should not insert a space following the hash?
- (FM) The conformation message for 'make script exec.' is not visible (see fix
  in perl-support).
- (FM) Rename function 'g:Awk_RereadTemplates'.

Bash:
- (FM) 'code->comment' should not insert a space following the hash?
- (FM) The conformation message for 'make script exec.' is not visible (see fix
  in perl-support).

C/C++:
- (FM, DONE) Documentation: Change documentation with regard to Make integration.
  * 'Run' menu entries removed.
  * Maps configured in ftplugin.
  * Reference documentation of toolbox.
  * Reference toolbox in 'c-hotkeys.tex'?
  * Document 'g:C_UseToolbox' and 'g:C_UseTool_*'.
  * Menu entry 'Run->executable to run' is not part of the Make integration
    anymore, since the Make integration moves to the toolbox. It is to be
    documented as configuration for 'Run->run', similar to 'Run->cmdline arg.'.
    Shortcut changes to '\re'.

  * (DONE) Append "short, after member" to several lines.

- (WM) How about jumping to windows?
  * (DONE) Open the buffer in a new window.
  * Optionally: Jump across tab pages.
- (WM, DONE?) Problem with 's:OpenFile()':
  Since the name of the buffer has to match exactly, this does not always work
  with different working directories.
- (WM, DONE?) Maps for completing Git commands, branches, tags, remotes, ...
  similar to the cmd-line completion plug-in.
- (WM) New status buffer output (version > 1.8.5):

  is extremely slow for diff and log.
